* My C Project Template
Here is the project format:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
  .
  ├── Makefile
  ├── include
  │   └── common.h
  └── src
      └── main.c
#+END_SRC
All the source files go in ~src~ and all the header files go in ~include~.
It can be changed by modifying the Makefile (see how below).

** Makefile
~SRC_ROOT~ dictates the root of the source directory.

The default value of ~SRC_ROOT~ is ~src~.

The same same applies with ~HEADER_ROOT~.


~OUT~ specifies the resulting executable name.

~CFLAGS~ specifies any C flags you may need.


~make [debug|analyze|release|clean|format|debugger]~ is self explanatory.

It also generates a ~compile_flags.txt~ from ~CFLAGS~, ~INCLUDE~, and ~WARNINGS~.

** Contributing
Contributions are welcome and I would like feedback if you have any.

If you need anything or have feedback just open an issue or message me on [[https://t.me/kanye4prez2024][Telegram]].
